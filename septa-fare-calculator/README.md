# SEPTA Rail Fare Calculator Challenge

Hello, hopeful Think Brownstone development team member! Thanks for taking time to help us assess your front-end development skills with this SEPTA Regional Rail fare data challenge. Part of the work we frequently are tasked with is combining complex business data with our design team's fresh new interfaces and making it come to life in the form of semantic, accessible HTML/CSS and Javascript.

The data in [fares.json](fares.json) here is based upon the information found on [SEPTA's website](http://www.septa.org/fares/ticket/index.html). When you take regional rail in and out of the city, the fare price is affected by where you purchase the ticket, when you board, and how far you travel. Let's make this information easier to understand by making an interactive fare purchase widget, illustrated in the screenshot below.

## Instructions
* Develop the front-end HTML and CSS for the widget seen in the screenshot above. 
* Assume that this widget would be handed off to a backend template integration developer who would be placing it on a page with other content and widgets when you are making decisions about naming conventions.
* Write Javascript to request [fares.json](fares.json) via AJAX and populate the widget with live data. Users should be able to see the fare total update when they use the widget controls.
* We care more about functionality than style - we'd rather see a partially styled working prototype than a pixel-perfect widget that isn't doing fare calculations.
* Add lots of comments to your code stating any assumptions or decisions you're making during this assignment -- or just to say hi. :-)

## Requirements
* *Browsers*: Internet Explorer 8+, Google Chrome for OS X, Safari for iOS 9, and Chrome for Android 5 and Android 6.
* *Libraries & Frameworks*: You are welcome to bring in Javascript libraries (like jQuery) or frameworks (like Angular or React), or author your JS with vanilla DOM methods as long as they are compatible the browser requirements. Please don't include an entire CSS framework like Bootstrap -- we want to see your HTML/CSS, not theirs.
* *Standards*: Your markup should be valid, semantic, accessible, and performant. To get an idea of what how we're doing things, please feel free to review our [development standards](http://ph.ly/styleguide).
* *Time*: This assignment should be finished in 60 minutes.
* *Submission*: Fork this repository and make a pull request for us to review your code.
